I am Madhurima Mondal, a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University.My research centers around drug repurposing, with a focus on integrating Geometric Deep Learning and Large Language Models to advance biomedical discovery.

Beyond the algorithms, and drug molecules, I am trained in Rabindra Sangeet and enjoy painting. I am an avid painter with a passion for photography and enjoy capturing the beauty of everyday moments. Additionally, I have a deep appreciation for literature, which enrich my understanding of my cultural heritage. 

Surprisingly, even on the pickleball court, I like my shots thoughtful and well-placed.
