# About Me

I am Madhurima Mondal, a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University. My research focuses on Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Graph Neural Networks, and Large Language Models. I have extensive experience working on projects like drug repurposing for cancer treatments and music generation using GANs.

In addition to my technical pursuits, I am trained in Rabindra Sangeet and enjoy painting. I often translate vivid images into my own artistic interpretations, bringing them to life on canvas with a blend of colors and emotions.
