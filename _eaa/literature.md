## Literature
In my spare time, I enjoy reading historical works, personal-growth literature, and deeply layered narratives. I have a profound appreciation for Bengali literary fiction—especially works that illuminate the raw textures of rural life or human relationships. Two favorites are [Hansuli Banker Upakatha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansuli_Banker_Upakatha_%28novel%29) by **Tarashankar Bandyopadhyay**, which evocatively portrays rural Bengal, and [Tenida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenida) by **Narayan Gangopadhyay**, cherished for its humor and youthful camaraderie. These reflect not just my reading journey but also a cultivated literary sensibility rooted in cultural depth.
