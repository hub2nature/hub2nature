We present a theoretical systems biology model for identifying therapeutic combinations of metabolic and immune pathway inhibitors to treat colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM). The study proposes novel repurposing strategies using Boolean networks and simulations of pathway dynamics to predict effective single and combination therapies. (Under review).
