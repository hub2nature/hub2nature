This study presents a Boolean network-based computational approach to identify potential drug targets within gene regulatory pathways relevant to triple-negative breast cancer stem cells. By integrating literature-derived pathway data and simulating network dynamics, the study identifies key nodes whose perturbation may effectively suppress tumorigenic behavior.
