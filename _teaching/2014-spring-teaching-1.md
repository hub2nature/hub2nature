### Description

In my teaching roles, I have provided significant support to students through lab sessions, grading, and one-on-one assistance. I have been involved in courses covering both digital systems design and electrical engineering principles, handling classes of up to 100 students. My aim has been to enhance student understanding and performance through effective teaching and mentorship.
