# 🎓 PhD Life: A Crash Course in Everything, All at Once

Doing a PhD is like trying to master the art of cooking, firefighting, and stand-up comedy — all while blindfolded and occasionally being asked to present your progress in front of experts.  

On paper, I’m a PhD student specializing in biomedical AI research. In reality?  
I’m a full-time researcher, part-time project manager, occasional data wrangler, semi-qualified IT support, and emotional support animal — to myself.

## 🔄 Multitasking: Because Apparently Sleep Is Optional

- 🧬 One moment I’m writing code to extract features from protein sequences...  
- 📄 The next I’m editing a LaTeX figure caption that refuses to center itself.  
- 📉 Just when I finish tuning one model, a new preprint drops on arXiv that makes mine feel prehistoric.

So back I go, updating pipelines — because in AI + biomedical research, nothing stays *state-of-the-art* for more than three weeks.  

Multitasking isn’t just a skill — it’s a survival mechanism. And no, I haven’t figured out how to hold a Zoom call with a collaborator while debugging code and reheating lunch... but I’m close.

## 🧠 Leading a Project (a.k.a. Convincing Yourself You Know What You’re Doing)

- 👩‍💼 The beautiful (and mildly terrifying) truth about a PhD is: **you’re the CEO of your own little startup**  
  — with no funding, no staff, and a to-do list that regenerates overnight.  
- 🎯 There’s no one to tell you the next exact step. You learn to plan your own roadmap, shift direction mid-sprint, and sometimes fake calm while everything breaks silently.

But here's the catch: **you grow**.  
You stop waiting for external validation and start trusting your research instincts. That’s where the magic begins.

## 🤝 Collaboration: The Secret Sauce (and Occasional Chaos)

- 💬 Despite the independence, research thrives on conversation.  
- 🧑‍🏫 “Quick” meetings that last 2 hours? They often solve a week’s worth of roadblocks.  
- 🧪 Some of my best breakthroughs happened when a colleague casually said,  
  *“What if you try this instead?”*

Learning to collaborate — across disciplines, time zones, and personalities — has been one of the most **real-life-changing** parts of this journey.

## 🚀 Keeping Up With AI in Biomedicine: A Full-Time Job (on Top of Your Full-Time Job)

- 🔁 The pace of AI in biomedical research? Like drinking from a firehose... while jogging.  
- 📚 Every week brings a new paper, model, or benchmark promising to revolutionize drug discovery.  
- 🔍 You start out wanting to read *everything*. You eventually learn to skim like a caffeine-fueled detective.

The key?  
Don’t chase everything. **Stay curious. Stay adaptable. Bookmark what matters. Ignore the hype. Build steadily.**

## 🎯 The TL;DR?

A PhD is hard, hilarious, humbling, and strangely addictive.  
It’s not about knowing everything — it’s about learning how to ask the right questions, and survive the chaos (preferably with snacks and sarcasm).

And if you’re on this journey too?  
👉 **Back up your data. Laugh daily. You're doing great.**
